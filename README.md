# 🧮 Matrix-Multiply: SIMD and Task Parallelism

## Overview

This project implements and analyzes **matrix multiplication** using both **iterative** and **divide-and-conquer** algorithms.  
It explores different **parallelization strategies** with **OpenMP** and evaluates performance improvements
from **cache-friendly optimizations** such as loop interchange and register blocking.
